This project is using [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/sv-se/azure/cognitive-services/welcome) for image recognition. 

To use this You need an API key from [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/sv-se/azure/cognitive-services/welcome) for their cognitive services.

I havenÂ´t inplemented any local storage for storing the key between runs, everytime You run the app You need to provide the API-Key.
